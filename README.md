#Code for Multi Sensor Coursework
Customised EIDORS code and python code for image manipulation and processing for Multi-Sensor coursework.
Note to potential employers: This code was written fast and dirty to a tight deadline and is not of high quality, it was however,
entirely unnecessary to write, but created due to a preference for spending 8 hours automating than 4 hours doing something manually.
